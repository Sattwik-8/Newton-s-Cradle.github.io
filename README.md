Newton's Cradle
<br>
This repository contains a simple web-based simulation of Newton's Cradle, designed using HTML and CSS. Newton's Cradle is a device that demonstrates conservation of momentum and energy, often used as a physics toy or desk accessory. In this project, the cradle consists of five swinging spheres, and the animation illustrates how motion and energy are transferred between them.
