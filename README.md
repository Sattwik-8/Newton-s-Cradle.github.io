# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for
Newton's Cradle - Simulation
Description:
Welcome to the Newton's Cradle project! This is a simple simulation of the famous Newton's Cradle device, built entirely with HTML and CSS. The cradle consists of a series of metal spheres, demonstrating the principles of conservation of momentum and energy when they collide.

This project visually represents how the motion of one sphere is transferred through the others, making it a fun and educational tool for physics enthusiasts or anyone interested in web animations.



## Features

- Pure HTML and CSS design with no external libraries
- Smooth, responsive animations to simulate the cradle's movement
- A minimalist and clean interface, making it lightweight and fast
- Cross platform
